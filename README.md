# Kaleidoscope

This project was created in partnership with Martha Trevino for an assignment by David Matuszek at the University of Pennsylvania in Fall 2014, and was based on his MVC program "The Bouncing Ball" available at [https://github.com/DavidMatuszek/BouncingBall2014](https://github.com/DavidMatuszek/BouncingBall2014).

The Kaleidoscope uses a Model-View-Controller architecture to display various geometric shapes reflected across the screen. The user of the GUI can control not only which shapes appear but how many reflections of each model are visualized on the screen.
